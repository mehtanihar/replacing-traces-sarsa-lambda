I have provided a solution to Exercise 7.7 in the textbook by Sutton and Barto (1998):


http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node80.html.

To run the code accumulating_traces.py

Just run the following command:

./assignment3.sh accumulating_traces.py

The data shall be printed to the file data_accumulating.txt


To run the code replacing_traces.py

Just run the following command:

./assignment3.sh accumulating_traces.py

The data shall be printed to the file data_replacing.txt

This is part of Assignment 3 of CS 747 course at IIT Bombay.
